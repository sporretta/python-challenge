Module 3 Challenge

For this challenge I used many online resources to help me with formatting and syntax. I had a tutoring session and used ask BCS. The pieces of code that required additional source assistance were storeing the profit changes in PyBank over each period, storing the date of the greatest iincrease and decrease in PyBank, and printing all the candidates in PyPoll.

My sources used are as follows:
